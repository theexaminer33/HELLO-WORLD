# HELLO-WORLD
Just another repository
My name is Mandlenkosi Makombe and I am new in this GitHub thing but I will soon become a Guru in it. So help me when ever you can so that I stay on the right path. thank you in advance.
I am an African who seeks to see a better tomorrow for myself and for those that are around me particularly in Africa. It is my hope that we can make the African continent to become a better world by contributing positivly together as one.
